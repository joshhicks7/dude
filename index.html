                    <p class="poem-line">I told you to floss, I said it with care,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">But you didn't listen, you didn't dare.</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">Two minutes a day, that's all it would take,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">But now you're here with a big mistake.</p>
                    
                    <p class="poem-line">Three teeth are gone, they've left the scene,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">Your smile's not what it used to have been.</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">The floss sat there, unused and ignored,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">Now your dental health can't be restored.</p>
                    
                    <p class="poem-line">I warned you, my friend, I tried to explain,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">But you brushed it off (pun intended) in vain.</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">Now you're toothless in places, it's quite a sight,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">Shoulda listened when I said "floss every night."</p>
                    
                    <p class="poem-line">So here's the lesson, plain and clear,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">Floss your teeth, have no fear.</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">Or end up like you, with gaps in your grin,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">Wishing you'd listened and let flossing begin.</p>
