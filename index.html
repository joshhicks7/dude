                    <p class="poem-line">I shoulda told you to floss, I shoulda said it with care,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">But I didn't say nothing, I wasn't there.</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">Two minutes a day, that's all it would take,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">But now you're here with a big mistake.</p>
                    
                    <p class="poem-line">Three teeth are gone, they've left the scene,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">Your smile's not what it used to have been.</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">The floss sat there, unused and ignored,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">Now your dental health can't be restored.</p>
                    
                    <p class="poem-line">I shoulda warned you, my friend, I shoulda tried to explain,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">But I kept my mouth shut (pun intended) in vain.</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">Now you're toothless in places, it's quite a sight,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">Shoulda told you to floss every single night.</p>
                    
                    <p class="poem-line">So here's the lesson, plain and clear,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">I shoulda been a better friend, have no fear.</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">But you shoulda flossed anyway, with gaps in your grin,</p>
                    <p class="poem-line">Wishing you'd known better and let flossing begin.</p>
